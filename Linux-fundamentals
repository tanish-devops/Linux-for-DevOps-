## Linux Fundamentals

#1 what is Linux?
Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system built around the Linux kernel.  
It manages hardware resources and provides an interface for users and applications.

#2 Linux Architecture view

user -- shell(bash) -- kernal -- Hardware

#3 Kernal (Heart)

core of the OS.
its manage - CPU, Memory, Devices, Processes, Filesystem

#4 Shell

The CLI that allow users to intract with the system.
most common shell - Bash
other shell - sh , ksh , zsh


#5 Linux File system structure

Open CLI and Run 
1- cd /  (for root user)
2- ls -ltr  (will show you file structure)

> / (Root directory)
> /home (User directories)
> /etc (confoiguration directories)
> /var (Logs and variable directories)
> /bin (essential sys binaries)
> /usr (installed software)
> /tmp (temporary files)

- you can open them and view, run (cd <dir_name>)

#6 navigation cmd
> pwd - print working dir
> ls - list of files
> cd dir_name - change dir
> mkdir - create dir
> rm file.txt - delete files
> rm -r folder -delete folder
> cp file1.txt file2.txt - copy file
> mv name1 name2  - rename file or dir


#7 file view and edit
> cat file.txt  -content in file
> head -n 5 file.txt  -first 10 line view
> vi file.txt  -open text editor (a powerful, modal text editor in Linux)
> nan0 file.txt  - simple file text editor


#8 file permissions

file permission - read, write or execute.

# Understanding Permission Numbers 
r = 4
w = 2
x = 1

eg: 
> chmod 777 file  - Full access to everyone (never use in prod)
> chmod 755 file  - Owner full access, others read & execute
> chmod 644 file  - Owner read/write, others read only

-rwxr-xr--
It means:

Owner → read, write, execute
Group → read, execute
Others → read only

> ls -l  - Lists files with detailed permissions and ownership
> chmod 755 filename  - Changes file permission using numeric mode
> chmod u+x filename  - Adds execute permission to file owner
> chmod g-w filename  - Removes write permission from group
> chown user filename  - Changes file owner
> chown user:group filename  - Changes owner and group
> chgrp group filename  - Changes group ownership
> umask  - Shows default permission mask
> umask 022  - Sets default permission mask
> getfacl filename  - Displays Access Control List (ACL) permissions
> setfacl -m u:user:rwx filename  - Sets ACL permission for a user

# security best pratices
1 never use chmod 777 in prod.
2 always follow least privalage principle.
3. restrict sensitive files to 600 (only file owner can read and write)

#9 user management
> whoami  - Shows the current logged-in user
> id  - Displays user ID (UID), group ID (GID), and groups
> sudo command  - Executes a command with superuser privileges
> useradd username  - Creates a new user
> userdel username  - Deletes an existing user
> usermod username  - Modifies user properties
> usermod -aG group username  - Adds user to a group
> groupadd groupname  - Creates a new group
> groupdel groupname  - Deletes a group
> passwd username  - Sets or changes a user password
> su username  - Switches to another user
> exit  - Returns to previous user session
> chage -l username  - Displays password expiry information
> loginctl list-users  - Lists logged-in users (systemd systems)
> last  - Shows login history of users
